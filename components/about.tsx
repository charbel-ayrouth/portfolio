      <p>
        Hey there! I'm <span className="font-medium">Charbel Ayrouth</span>, a
        recent{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">software engineering graduate</span> who
        jumped into a full-time tech job even before graduation. Although my job
        doesn't involve coding, it's taught me a lot about technology and how to
        solve problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time,{" "}
        <span className="italic">I love coding and hitting the gym</span>.
        Coding is like a hobby to meâ€”it's creative and fun. I enjoy figuring out
        solutions to problems and making things work.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm on a journey to become a{" "}
        <span className="underline">full-stack web developer</span>. I've got a
        good start in support engineering, and now I'm excited to dive deeper
        into coding and build cool stuff on the web.
